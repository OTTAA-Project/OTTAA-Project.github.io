title: Technology Standards.
---

Open standards establish protocols and building blocks that can help make digital public goods more functional and interoperable. This not only streamlines product development, but it also removes vendor-imposed boundaries to read or write data files by improving data exchange and open source development support that's why we use the following Technology Standard across our software and implementations. 

<ul>
<li>HTTPS for secure communicate over networks</li>
<li>OAuth 2 for authentication and user authorization</li>
<li>UTF-8 for string localization and internalization</li>
<li>JSON for database structure and data transfer</li>
<li>PNG & Webp for images and pictograms</li>
<li>OGG for audio files</li>
</ul>
